# FAQ/Q&A

Q1: Does Smash Remix Debugged use the latest Smash Remix patch?

A1: Yes, it does!

Q2: Does the mod modify/change or delete anything from Vanilla Smash Remix?

A2: No! the mod has all content already available on Vanilla Smash Remix!

Q3: Does the mod add new characters, stages, items, songs, or game modes?

A3: Technically, no, the only added character is Sandbag, and the only added stages are "Home-Run Contest", "Soccer" and "Time Twister (SSS)" (variants for "Duel Zone", "Smashketball" and "Time Twister") which were stages that were already in the game, just not normally accessible, but now they are, same for some songs, it also doesn't add any new items or game modes, however.

Q4: Can i use this mod for my tournament?

A4: Yes, you can! That's why there's a new 4th tourney stage page in the mod! It's optional though, meaning that if you want, you can still use vanilla Smash Remix for your tournaments!

# Modder's FAQ/Q&A

Q1/Q2: Does the mod run on the latest 'original.z64' file/I need to port all of my work imported to the previous original.z64 to the new one?

A1/A2: Yes, it does! The mod itself is based/build of the latest original.z64 file (and also from the latest Smash Remix patch) meaning that if you ported, added or changed something to the original.z64, you won't have any worries of having to re-import it to the "new" one.

## Building
### THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE SOURCE CODE OF THE MOD. PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE RELEASE VERSION BY CLICKING THE RELEASE TAB.
The original xdelta will generate a smash rom that is compatible with our ASM code. Much of our edits are done within
the compressed files within the rom. If you utilize a vanilla Smash 64 rom, it will not work correctly.

You must utilize the xdelta patch to generate a good rom for Assembly.

You must place your legally acquired patched ROM in the 'roms' folder for this to work. It must be named ssb.rom
